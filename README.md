## Image search engine
- Creating a frontend application to search and browse images by keyword
- Pixabay's public API was used for HTTP requests
- An array of images meeting the criteria of the request parameters appears in the response.
- If relevant images are not found, a message is displayed.
- With each response, the site displays 40 objects, after clicking Load more it sends a request for the next group of images.
- Thanks to the SimpleLightBox library and the added function, clicking on an image displays a larger version of it.
